# COVAM Runs and Data

These folders include all the corresponding executable files used to generate the figures in the paper describing COVAM.  Each is labeled according to the type of run it was tailored to.  The batch files include the commands required to execute the executable files. All executable files are named as "CovidABM.exe."  There are additional Excel files corresponding to each location that include all underlying data used to generate the figures. 

All folders labeled as "SA" refer to Sensitivity Analysis tests. Each SA folder will contain a separate folder for the adherence, delay, and stop that pertain to the given sensitivity analysis that was performed.

Below is a list of which figures correspond with each folder. This information can also be found within each run.
